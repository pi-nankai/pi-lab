                            <p>Underwater image enhancement refers to the process of improving the quality and visibility of images captured underwater. When an image is taken underwater, it is often affected by various factors such as water turbidity, scattering of light, color distortion, and reduced contrast. These factors result in images with poor visibility, low contrast, and a bluish or greenish tint. Underwater image enhancement techniques aim to mitigate these issues and enhance the visual quality of underwater images.</p>
                            <p>We focus on the research of underwater image enhancement and investigate the relationship between underwater image enhancement and other underwater vision tasks such as underwater object detection. </p>

                            <p>Universal image enhancement and restoration techniques are designed to significantly improve image quality across various applications. These methods address key issues such as super-resolution, denoising, dehazing, and rain removal, enhancing clarity and detail. Deblurring and face restoration restore sharpness and accuracy, while automatic photo retouching simplifies the enhancement process. Low-light enhancement and underwater restoration ensure high-quality visuals in challenging environments. Exposure correction and color correction refine lighting and hues for true-to-life representation. All-in-one restoration combines these solutions into a seamless toolset, enabling clearer, more accurate images for diverse industries, from healthcare to entertainment.</p>

                            <p>Image dehazing is a process of reducing or removing the atmospheric haze or fog-like effects that degrade the visibility and quality of images. Haze occurs when light interacts with particles and molecules in the atmosphere, causing scattering and absorption. In images captured in hazy conditions, objects farther away appear less distinct and have reduced contrast compared to objects closer to the camera. The goal of image dehazing is to recover the underlying scene information and enhance the visibility of objects by estimating and removing the haze or fog.</p>

The term "blind" signifies that the restoration algorithm operates without explicit information or annotations about the face in the input image. Blind face restoration algorithms aim to improve the visual quality of facial images by addressing common issues such as noise, blur, low resolution, and other distortions.</p>

                            <p>Flare removal refers to the process of reducing or eliminating lens flare from images. Lens flare occurs when unwanted light scatters or reflects within the camera lens system, resulting in bright spots, streaks, or haze in the image. Flare can occur due to various factors, such as strong light sources in the frame, direct sunlight hitting the lens, or internal reflections within the lens elements. Flare removal techniques aim to mitigate the negative effects of lens flare and restore the original image quality.</p>

                            <p>Under-Display Camera (UDC) image restoration refers to the process of enhancing the quality and visual appearance of images captured by cameras located underneath the display of electronic devices, such as smartphones or tablets. UDC technology allows for a full-screen display without the need for a visible camera notch or bezel. Since the camera is placed underneath the screen, the image quality can be affected by factors such as reduced light transmission, diffraction, and interference from the display pixels. Therefore, UDC image restoration techniques aim to compensate for these limitations and improve the overall image quality.</p>
                            <p>We explore the potential of UDC and provide the solutions of UDC image synthetis and restoration.</p>

                            <p>Image colorization refers to the process of adding color to black and white or grayscale images to create a colorized version. It involves assigning appropriate colors to different elements and areas within the image based on various factors, such as context, knowledge of the subject matter, and artistic interpretation. Image colorization involves a degree of interpretation and subjectivity, as the original colors may not be known or accurately preserved in black and white images. The process often relies on historical knowledge, cultural references, and artistic choices. Colorization can bring new life to old photographs, add visual appeal, and provide a fresh perspective on historical or nostalgic imagery.</p>
                            <p>We focus on unconditional, prompt-based, hint-point-based, reference-based image and video colorization.</p>

                            <p>In the context of image restoration, the term "backbone" refers to the fundamental architecture or framework used in deep learning models for image restoration tasks. The backbone network forms the core of the model and is responsible for extracting meaningful features from input images. The choice of the backbone architecture depends on the specific image restoration task and the complexity of the problem. Different architectures have been developed and adapted for image restoration, each with its own strengths and characteristics.</p>
                            <p>We focus on the design of image restoration backbones, particularly in the frequency domain.</p>
